# jstmax!'s [w!] system
what is this? \
basically: in my CLI programs, I use my own warning system to warn (wow) the user about stuff that happens \
e.g. `[e!] example error: description` for errors \
in this file I'll write a list of every warning I use;

## .categoryOne, basicWarningsðŸ¤“
|warningâœ¨|explanationðŸ“‘|
|-|-|
|[e!]|used for errors, e.g. `[e!] task (taskName) failed`|
|[n!]|used for notes, e.g. `[n!] this program supports (featureName)`|
|[w!]|used for warning (lol), e.g. `[w!] using (functionName) could lead to (issueName)`|
